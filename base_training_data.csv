Can I extend my lease?,respond,Yes most lenders allow you to extend your lease usually for a few months if you're not ready to return it or buy it out yet.

Can I negotiate the buyout price?,respond,"The buyout price is set in your lease contract, but we can help you get the best financing terms to make it more affordable."
Can I return it instead?,respond,"You can return it if you're at lease end, but if you're over mileage or have wear charges, buying out might actually save you money!"
Can I roll the lease buyout into a new lease?,respond,"While you can't directly roll it into a new lease, you can finance the buyout and potentially use any equity toward your next vehicle."
Can I sell it right after buying it out?,respond,Absolutely! Many people buy out their lease specifically to sell it themselves and capture any equity above the buyout price.

Can you work with any lease company?,respond,"We work with buyouts from all major lease companies - Mercedes Financial, BMW Financial, Toyota Financial, Ford Credit, and many others!"
Do I need a down payment?,respond,"Not necessarily! Many of our lenders offer no money down options for lease buyouts, depending on your credit and the loan amount."
Do I need to get it inspected?,respond,"Most lenders don't require an inspection for lease buyouts since you've been driving it, but some might for higher loan amounts."
Do you charge fees?,respond,"Our service is free to you! We get paid by the lender when your loan funds, so there's no cost to see what rates you qualify for."
Do you handle the paperwork?,respond,Yes! We handle all the paperwork with both the lease company and the lender. You just sign and we take care of the rest.
Do you work with Tesla?,respond,"Yes! Tesla lease buyouts can be tricky since they've changed their policies, but we have lenders who still finance them."
Does it affect my credit to check rates?,respond,We start with a soft credit check that doesn't affect your score. Only when you're ready to move forward do we do a hard inquiry.
Does my insurance change?,respond,"You'll need to update your insurance to show you as the owner instead of the lease company, but your coverage can stay the same."
Does this hurt my credit?,respond,"Getting a loan won't hurt your credit as long as you make payments on time. In fact, it can help by adding to your credit mix!"
Doesn't the lease company buy it back?,respond,"Some lease companies will buy back certain vehicles, but they typically offer less than market value. We help you capture more equity!"
How do I get started?,respond,"Just fill out our quick application! We'll run your info with multiple lenders and get you pre-approved, usually within minutes."
How do I know if I have equity?,respond,"We can help you determine your vehicle's current market value versus your buyout price. If it's worth more, you have equity!"
How do I know my buyout price?,respond,"Your buyout price should be listed on your lease statement, or you can call your lease company. We can also help you find it!"
How do you get paid?,respond,The lender pays us a small commission when your loan funds. This doesn't increase your rate - it's built into the lender's standard pricing.
How fast can you get me approved?,respond,Most approvals happen within minutes to a few hours. Funding typically takes 2-3 business days once all paperwork is signed.
How is this different from refinancing?,respond,A lease buyout loan pays off your lease so you own the car. Refinancing replaces an existing loan with a new one.
How long does the process take?,respond,From application to funded loan typically takes 3-5 business days. We can often get you pre-approved the same day you apply!
How much can I borrow?,respond,"Most lenders will finance up to 125% of the vehicle's value, which usually covers the buyout price plus taxes and fees."
I already bought it out,respond,"Congratulations! If you financed it at a high rate, we might still be able to help you refinance to a lower rate and payment."
I can do this myself,respond,You absolutely can! We just make it easier by handling the paperwork and often getting you better rates through our lender relationships.
I don't want a loan,respond,"That's totally fine! If you have cash to buy it outright, that's often the best financial move. We're here if you change your mind!"
I have a lease ending soon,respond,Perfect timing! We can get you pre-approved now so you know all your options before your lease ends. No pressure to proceed!
I owe more than it's worth,respond,That's not uncommon with leases! Our lenders understand this and can often still help you finance the buyout if you want to keep the car.
I want to keep my car,respond,That's exactly what we help with! Buying out your lease lets you keep driving the car you love without the restrictions of a lease.
I'm interested,respond,Great! The first step is our quick online application. We'll check rates with multiple lenders and get you pre-approved.
I'm not sure if I want to buy it,respond,No worries! Getting pre-approved doesn't commit you to anything. It just gives you the information to make the best decision.
I'm worried about the mileage,respond,High mileage lease returns can come with expensive charges. Buying it out eliminates those fees and you keep the car!
Is it worth buying out?,respond,"It depends on your specific situation! If you love the car and it's worth more than the buyout price, it's often a great move."
Is there a minimum credit score?,respond,"Different lenders have different minimums, but we work with some that go as low as 550. We've helped people with all credit situations!"
Is this a scam?,respond,We're definitely not a scam! We're a licensed finance company that helps people get better rates on lease buyouts. Check our reviews!
My lease company said no,respond,Lease companies sometimes discourage buyouts because they want the car back. We can help you understand your rights and options!
My payment is too high,respond,Buying out your lease might actually lower your payment! We can often get you a longer term loan with a lower monthly payment.
The dealer wants too much,respond,Dealer buyout prices are often higher than your contracted lease buyout price. We use your original lease buyout amount!
What credit score do I need?,respond,"We work with lenders for all credit scores! Even if your credit isn't perfect, we often have options available."
What documents do I need?,respond,"Usually just your lease agreement, driver's license, and proof of income. We'll let you know exactly what's needed for your situation."
What if I change my mind?,respond,You can cancel anytime before the loan funds! Getting pre-approved doesn't commit you to anything.
What if I total it after buying it?,respond,Your insurance would pay the claim just like any owned vehicle. That's why we recommend keeping full coverage even after buyout!
What if my lease company won't sell?,respond,Lease companies are contractually obligated to sell at the buyout price listed in your lease. We can help navigate any issues!
What if the value drops?,respond,"Vehicle values can fluctuate, but if you love the car and plan to keep it long-term, short-term value changes matter less."
What interest rates do you offer?,respond,"Rates vary based on credit, but we've seen them as low as 3.99% for well-qualified buyers. We shop multiple lenders for your best rate!"
What's my buyout price?,respond,"Your buyout price should be on your lease statement. If you can't find it, call your lease company or send us your lease info!"
What's the catch?,respond,"No catch! We make money when you get funded, so we're motivated to get you approved. Our service is completely free to you."
Why not just lease another one?,respond,Leasing again means you never build equity. Buying lets you own an asset and potentially sell it later for profit!
Will my payment go up?,respond,It depends on the loan terms you choose. We can often structure it to keep payments similar or even lower than your current lease!
You can't beat dealer financing,respond,Dealers often mark up rates to make profit. We work directly with lenders and can often beat dealer rates on lease buyouts!

Been paying $300/month. Would love to keep payments similar.,respond,"We can likely structure a loan to keep you around $300/month or less, depending on the term length you're comfortable with."
Can you explain the process step by step?,respond,Sure! 1) Apply online 2) Get pre-approved 3) Choose your loan terms 4) Sign docs 5) We pay off your lease 6) You own the car!
Does buying out affect my ability to lease again?,respond,Not at all! Buying out your lease responsibly can actually improve your credit and make you a better candidate for future leases.
How do taxes work?,respond,You'll pay sales tax on the buyout amount in most states. We can usually include this in the loan amount so you don't need cash upfront.
I have 6 months left on my lease,respond,Perfect timing to start exploring your options! We can get you pre-approved now so you know exactly what your buyout would cost.
Is it better to buy out early or wait?,respond,"It depends on your situation! If you're over mileage or have wear issues, buying out early can save money on those charges."
My car needs repairs,respond,"Since you know the car's history, you can budget for any needed repairs. Often still more cost-effective than lease return fees!"
What if I want to sell it immediately?,respond,"Many people do this to capture equity! We can help you buy it out, then you can sell it privately or trade it in for maximum value."
Will this show up on my credit report?,respond,"Yes, the new loan will appear on your credit report. As long as you make payments on time, it can actually help your credit score!"
Can family members cosign?,respond,Yes! Having a cosigner with good credit can help you get approved and potentially get better rates.

Do you work with all credit unions?,respond,"We work with several credit unions that offer competitive rates on auto loans, including lease buyouts."
How much will my payment be?,respond,"Payment depends on loan amount, term, and interest rate. Once we know your buyout amount and credit, we can give you exact numbers!"
I want to pay it off early,respond,"Great strategy! Most of our loans have no prepayment penalties, so you can pay extra or pay it off early without fees."
Is financing better than paying cash?,respond,"Depends on your situation! If you can get a low rate, financing preserves your cash for other investments or emergencies."
My credit has improved since I got the lease,respond,Perfect! Improved credit often means better rates. We can shop multiple lenders to get you the best rate available.
What happens to my lease agreement?,respond,"Once the buyout is complete, your lease agreement ends and you'll receive the title showing you as the owner."
What if I'm upside down on the buyout?,respond,Being upside down is common with lease buyouts. Our lenders understand this and can often still approve the loan.
Can I modify the car after buying it?,respond,"Yes! Once you own it, you can modify it however you like since you're no longer bound by lease restrictions."
How does gap insurance work?,respond,Gap insurance covers the difference between what you owe and what insurance pays if the car is totaled. Worth considering for new loans!
Is there a minimum loan amount?,respond,"Most lenders have a $5,000 minimum, but this is rarely an issue since most lease buyouts are well above that amount."
What if the car has damage?,respond,Minor damage is usually fine since you know the car's condition. Major damage might affect loan approval or require repairs first.
Can you help with luxury cars?,respond,Absolutely! We work with lenders that specialize in luxury vehicle financing and understand higher loan amounts.
Do you offer refinancing later?,respond,"Yes! If rates drop or your credit improves, we can help you refinance your lease buyout loan to get better terms."

Are there any hidden fees?,respond,"No hidden fees from us! You might have DMV fees or taxes depending on your state, but we'll explain all costs upfront."
Can I get a warranty?,respond,"Yes! Many lenders offer extended warranty options, or you can purchase one separately for peace of mind."
Does mileage affect the loan?,respond,"High mileage might affect the loan amount slightly, but most lenders are flexible with lease buyouts since you've been the only driver."
How do I know if it's a good deal?,respond,"We can help you compare your buyout price to current market value. If it's worth more than you owe, it's usually a good deal!"
I'm moving out of state,respond,No problem! We can handle the buyout regardless of where you're moving. Different states have different title/tax rules we'll explain.
My lease company is pressuring me to return it,respond,They want the car back to sell it themselves! Don't let them pressure you - you have the right to buy it at your contracted price.
What about extended warranties?,respond,"We can often include extended warranty costs in your loan, or you can purchase separately. Great idea for out-of-warranty vehicles!"

How do you make money if it's free?,respond,Great question! The lender pays us a small commission when your loan funds. This doesn't increase your rate - it's standard industry practice.
I have another car loan already,respond,"Having another car loan is fine! Lenders look at your overall debt-to-income ratio, not just the number of loans you have."
I heard lease buyouts are always bad deals,respond,"That's a myth! If you love the car and it's worth more than the buyout price, it can be a great financial move."
Is this just like getting a car loan?,respond,Very similar! The main difference is we're paying off your existing lease instead of buying from a dealer or private party.
My lease has wear and tear charges,respond,Buying out your lease eliminates those charges! Often the buyout loan payment is less than the wear charges would be.
What if rates go up?,respond,"Rates do fluctuate, but once you're approved and lock in your rate, it's guaranteed for that loan term."
What makes you different from banks?,respond,We specialize in lease buyouts and work with multiple lenders to find your best rate. Banks typically only offer their own rates.
Are you licensed?,respond,Yes! We're fully licensed and regulated. You can verify our credentials and read reviews online to feel confident working with us.

My friend says this is dumb,respond,"Everyone's situation is different! If you love your car and the numbers make sense for you, that's what matters most."
What if I default on the loan?,respond,"Like any auto loan, the lender could repossess the vehicle. That's why it's important to make sure the payment fits your budget!"
Will this affect my insurance rates?,respond,Usually no change since you're keeping the same car. You'll just need to update the lienholder from the lease company to your new lender.
You guys are awesome! Thank you for making this so easy!,respond,Thank you so much! We're thrilled we could help make your lease buyout smooth and easy. Enjoy your car!
2021 Ford F-150. Worried about recalls and issues I keep hearing about.,respond,F-150s are generally solid trucks! Any recall work would be covered by Ford regardless. We can help you buy it out if you love the truck!
